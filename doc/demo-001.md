subtitle: Some topics to cover when introducing users to the multizone-audio system.
---

# Apps
1. Spotify
2. Airplay
3. Web (Iris)
4. MPD / Mopidy
5. Show that Iris/MPD/Mopidy are the same but that the others are separate

# Basic playback
1. Play a track from Spotify to a mono-zone
2. Play a track from Spotify to a multi-zone
3. Do the same for Airplay

# Stream Priority
spotify > airplay > iris

1. Play a track from Iris, show the Spotify track taking priority

Consider: You may not be the only one playing

# Multi-zone
1. Play Spotify to a multi-zone stream, show zones reconfigured
2. Play a track to mono-zone, show that it takes precedence
3. Stop the mono-zone track, show that multi-zone takes over again

# Volume control
1. Demonstrate the independence of each service's volumes

Consider: Volume is controlled by your app â†’ full volume on your app means *full volume*

## What about Snapcast?
Snapcast is not for end-users, it is only for setting balance between zones.

This is reinforced by `snapcast-autoconfig`
