Details of topics to cover when introducing users to the multizone-audio system.

# Demonstration

0. Apps
  1. Spotify
  2. Airplay
  3. Web (Iris)
  4. MPD / UPNP
  5. Show that Iris/MPD/UPnP are the same but that the others are separate

1. Basic playback
  1. Play a track from Spotify to a mono-zone
  2. Play a track from Spotify to a multi-zone
  3. Do the same for Airplay

2. Stream priority (spotify > airplay > iris)
  1. Play a track from Iris, show the Spotify track taking priority

3. Multi-zone
  1. Play Spotify to a multi-zone stream, show zones reconfigured
  2. Play a track to mono-zone, show that it takes precedence
  3. Stop the mono-zone track, show that multi-zone takes over again

4. Volume control
  1. Demonstrate the independency of each service's volumes

# Considerations
* Volume is controlled by your app â†’ full volume on your app means *full volume*
* Stream priority: You may not be the only one playing

# For those used to using Snapcast
* snapcast is not for end-users, it is only for setting balance between zones
  * reinforced by snapcast-autoconfig
